        <td>1. Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?</td>
        <td>
          <p>1. HTML Tags and Elements are sometimes perceived as the same.
            However, they are not. There is a subtle difference between HTML
            elements and tags that many people aren't aware of. HTML Tags are
            building blocks of HTML Page. They tell the browser how it should
            display content to the user. A tag starts with a < bracket and ends with a> bracket.</p>

        <td>2. What are tags and attributes in HTML?</td>
        <td>
          <p>2. Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets.
            An example of a tag is:
          <h1>.
            Most tags must be opened <h1> and closed </h1> in order to function.
            Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form
            of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.</p>

        <td>3. What are void elements in HTML? With Example.</td>
        <td>3. A void element is an element in HTML that cannot have any child nodes. Void elements
          only have a start tag; end tags must not be specified for void elements.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4. What are HTML Entities? With Example.</td>
        <td>4. HTML entities are special characters that are used to represent reserved characters, special characters
          or invisible characters in HTML. HTML entity encoding is the
          conversion of HTML reserved characters to their corresponding entities for browsers to display them correctly.

        <td>5. What are different types of lists in HTML? With Example</td>
        <td>5. In HTML, there are three types of lists: unordered, ordered and description lists.
          Each of them is defined using different tags. Let’s have a look.
          Example of the HTML
          <ul> tag for creating an unordered list:
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>

            <head>
              <title>Title of the document</title>
            </head>

            <body>
              <h1>An unordered list:</h1>
              <ul>
                <li>This is a list item</li>
                <li>This is another list item</li>
                <li>This is one more list item</li>
              </ul>
            </body>

            </html>
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>

            <head>
              <title>Title of the document</title>
            </head>

            <body>
              <h1>An ordered list:</h1>
              <ol>
                <li>This is List item number 1</li>
                <li>This is List item number 2</li>
                <li>This is List item number 3</li>
              </ol>
            </body>

            </html>
            <dl>
              <!DOCTYPE html>
              <html>

              <head>
                <title>Title of the document</title>
              </head>

              <body>
                <h1>Description Lists:</h1>
                <dl>
                  <dt>Tea</dt>
                  <dd>- hot drink</dd>
                  <dt>Juice</dt>
                  <dd>- cold drink</dd>
                </dl>
              </body>

              </html>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>6. What is the ‘class’ attribute in HTML? With Example.</td>
        <td>6. The class attribute in HTML is used to define a class of elements. It is used to group elements with
          similar properties. The class attribute can be added to any HTML element. For example, if you want to style
          all the headings in your document with a specific font and color, you can add the class attribute to all the
          headings and then define the style for that class in your CSS file.

          Here’s an example of how to use the class attribute in HTML:

          <!DOCTYPE html>
          <html>

          <head>
            <style>
              .my-class {
                color: white;
                font-size: 20px;
              }
            </style>
          </head>

          <body>

            <h1 class="my-class">This is a heading</h1>
            <p class="my-class">This is a paragraph.</p>

          </body>

          </html>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>7. What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML
          elements? With Example.
        </td>
        <td>7. The main difference between the 'id' attribute and the 'class' attribute is that the 'id' attribute is
          used to identify a unique HTML element, while the 'class' attribute is used to specify a group of elements
          that share the same style or behavior¹².

          For example, if you have a paragraph element that you want to style differently from other paragraphs on your
          page, you can use an 'id' attribute to identify that specific paragraph. You can then use CSS to apply styles
          to that paragraph only.

          html
          <p id="unique-paragraph">This paragraph is unique.</p>


          On the other hand, if you have several paragraphs on your page that you want to style in the same way, you can
          use a 'class' attribute to group those paragraphs together. You can then use CSS to apply styles to all of
          those paragraphs at once.

          html
          <p class="common-paragraph">This paragraph is common.</p>
          <p class="common-paragraph">This paragraph is also common.</p>

      <tr>
        <td>8. What are the various formatting tags in HTML?</td>
        <td>8. HTML Text Formatting<br><b> - Bold text<br>Example->This text is bolds<br>
            <strong> - Important text
              <i> - Italic text<br> Example:-This text is italic<br>
                <em> - Emphasized text
                  <mark> - Marked text
                    <small> - Smaller text
                      <del> - Deleted text
                        <ins> - Inserted text
                          <sub> - Subscript text
                            <sup> - Superscript text</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>9. How is Cell Padding different form cell Spacing? With example</td>
        <td>9. Cellpadding and cellspacing are two attributes of HTML tables that are used to control the amount of
          space between the cells and the content within individual cells. Cellpadding is used to define the space
          between the border of a cell and its content. Cellspacing is used to define the space between adjacent cells
          in a table. For example, if you set cellpadding=5 and cellspacing=10, then each cell will have 5 pixels of
          padding around its content and there will be 10 pixels of space between adjacent cells</td>
      <tr>
        <td>10. How Can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table? With example
        </td>
        <td>10. To merge two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table, you can use the
          rowspan and colspan attributes in tag. The rowspan attribute is used to merge or combine the number of cells
          in a row whereas the colspan attribute is used to merge column cells in a table12.

          Here’s an example of how you can use these attributes to merge two cells in a table:

          <table>
            <tr>
              <td rowspan="2">Row 1 Column 1</td>
              <td>Row 1 Column 2</td>
              <td>Row 1 Column 3</td><br>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td colspan="2">Row 2 Column 2 and Column 3</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          Copy
          This will create a table with two rows and three columns. The first cell in the first row will span two rows,
          while the second and third cells in the first row will remain separate. The second cell in the second row will
          span two columns, while the third cell in the second row will remain separate1.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>11. What is a different between a block-level element and an inline element?</td>
        <td>11. In HTML, block-level elements are those that take up the full width available and always start on a new
          line. They create large blocks of content like paragraphs or page divisions.

          On the other hand, inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary.
          They are used for small bits of content that appear within a block-level element.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>12. How to create a Hyperlink in HTML ?What Example</td>
        <td>12. To create a hyperlink in HTML, you can use the <a> element. The <a> element stands for “anchor,” and it
              is used to create a hyperlink to another web page or a specific location on the same page.

              Here is an example of how to create a hyperlink in HTML:

              <a href="http://www.example.com">Link text</a>
              <a href="http://www.example.com" target="_blank">Link text</a></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>13. What is the use of an iframe tag? With Example </td>
        <td>13. HTML Iframe is used to display a nested webpage (a webpage within a webpage). The HTML <iframe> tag
            defines an inline frame, hence it is also called as an Inline frame.

      <tr>
        <td>14. What is the use of a span tag? Eaplaim With Example</td>
        <td>14. The <span> tag is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text or document. It can be used for
            styling purposes like highlighting a specific word within a paragraph or applying a different font size to a
            single character1. The <span> tag can also be used with CSS to create hover effects, animations, and other
              dynamic features on a web page. Here’s an example of how you can use the <span> tag to color a part of
                text:

                <p> My mother has <span style="color:blue"> blue </span> eyes. </p>

                In this example, the word “blue” is colored blue using the <span> tag</td>

        <td>15. To add a background image on an HTML element, use the HTML style attribute and the CSS
          background-imageproperty: You can also specify the background image in the <style>
            element,
            in the <head>section: Add a background image for the entire page: Example <style>body {
              background-image: url('img_girl.jpg');

      <tr>
        <td>16. How are active links differet from normal links?</td>
        <td>16. The default color for normal and active links is blue. Some browsers recognize an active link when the
          mouse cursor is placed over that link; others recognize active links when the link has the focus. Those that
          don’t have a mouse cursor over that link is considered a normal link.</td>

      <tr>
        <td>17. What are the different tags to separete sections of text?</td>
        <td>17. Three tags are used to separate the texts.

          <br> tag - Usually <br> tag is used to separate the line of text. It breaks the current line and conveys the
          flow to the next line

          <p> tag - The
          <p> tag contains the text in the form of a new paragraph.

          <blockquote> tag - It is used to define a large quoted section. If you have a large quotation, then put the
            entire text within <blockquote>HTML</blockquote> tag.

        <td>18. SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is a vector-based graphics format that defines graphics in
          XML format1. SVG images can be created and edited with any text editor, and they can be searched, indexed,
          scripted, and compressed. They are also scalable, meaning they can be printed with high quality at any
          resolution and do not lose any quality if they are zoomed or resized.</td>

        <td>20. What are logical and physical tags in HTML?</td>
        <td>20. In HTML, logical tags describe the meaning or structure of the content it surrounds, while physical tags
          describe the presentation or appearance of the content . Logical tags are also known as structural tags and
          present the functions of text on the page . Physical tags are used to provide the visual appearance to the
          text . Logical tags are used only to give information about the text, written in the HTML page.</td>
